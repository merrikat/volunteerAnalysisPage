# volunteerAnalysisPage
A web page to analyse volunteer application data from a CSV file

## Expected input data
Should be a CSV with columns:

*Date,Opportunity,Organisation,Title,First name,Last name,Email,Phone,Address,Postcode,Date of birth,Status*

I am 90 % convinced that the page will work even if the columns are not in that order.

## Output
The input data includes every application made, so applicants are generally listed more than once. The page summarises the data in the form:

*Name, Email, Phone, Number of opps, Opportunities*

where the *Opportunities* column is just all the things they applied for all smushed together in one column.
